# Bulk Email Sender (Python)

This is a simple Python application that allows users to send bulk emails with an optional PDF attachment. Built using `streamlit`, `smtplib`, and `email.mime` modules, the application provides an easy-to-use interface for sending customized emails to multiple recipients.

## Features

- Send bulk emails to multiple recipients
- Customize email subject and body content (supports HTML messages)
- Attach a PDF file to emails
- Simple user interface with `streamlit`
- Attachment file uploaded through the interface

## Note

- If you're using Gmail, ensure that "Less Secure Apps" is enabled or use an app-specific password for Gmail accounts with 2FA enabled.
- If there are issues with large attachments or connection timeouts, consider using a third-party email API like SendGrid or Mailgun.
